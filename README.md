## Memo App

### Description
This app allows users to make notes, save them to a database, and retrieve them at a later time.

## Usage
Users can create a new memo by using the plus sign in the top corner. They can then enter text, and press save when ready. If they want to see a memo they previously created, they can click on the memo on the left side, and it will reappear in the text-entry field.

## Credits
I would like to thank the instrucitonal staff and tutors who helped me figure out this project.
